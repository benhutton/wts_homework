# ST113 Doctrine of God Digest 1

## Bavinck

### Chapter 1

All dogmatics is about God, who cannot be fully grasped in a scientific sense, and must move us to worship. Though it may seem otherwise, Scripture makes clear that God is knowable and known by all in some sense. God is revealed in many ways in Scripture, and is "not confined to the world but exalted above it" (30). This is contested by many who would say that originally Israel worshiped stone, fire, or thunder gods, but Scripture shows clear consciousness of God residing in heaven, not in any one geographic spot.

The OT mentions many gods and appears to acknowledge their existence, but on closer inspection it consistently affirms YHWH as the one and only true God and presenting a consistent doctrine of God. In pagan worldviews, "the unity of the personality and absoluteness of God is broken" (34). Either God ends up generic and not a person, or he is claimed to be undescribable, or perhaps only in the negative.

God is incomprehensible - never exhaustively revealed. Only God can fully know God. What this means has evolved over time. For Augustine, describing God starts with "being", and everything else is essentially saying what God is not. Nothing positive could be said to describe God's essence. Early scholastics affirmed this, but eventually God became highly defined and incomprehensibility functionally disappeared. Eventually both the Reformers and the Roman Catholic church settled on a doctrine of incomprehensibility, but then in various circles in diminished in favor of a focus on knowing God's will.

Philosophers picked up this idea of God as incomprehensible, as Kant considered God to be transcendental - not objectively provable but subjectively assumed. Schleiermacher continued with the idea of an unknowable God. Feuerbach considered God to just be derived from humanity, but moderating this atheism a form of agnosticism rose as speculation was avoided and concrete facts and exact sciences won the day. Theology became the science of religion instead of the study of God.
